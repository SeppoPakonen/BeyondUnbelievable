It's time to put to bed the fairy tale of dark matter.

[Website about failed dark matter research 1]
Something so dark, of course, it's invisible, and so mysterious, that it remains undetected after decades of searching for it with sophisticated instruments, scanning all the known cosmos and the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

[Website about failed dark matter research 2]
But how can something be falsified that's this imperceptible?

[Informative image about big bang and expanding universe, and neutron star]
Of course, there are many other invisible non-existent astrophysical entities, such as dark energy and neutron stars, that have been invented and disseminated using disingenuous methods of measurement and interpretation onto a naive unsuspecting public.

But those are battles for another day.

[Image of a man's hand touching a leaf in a jungle forest]
Being a scientist is like being an explorer who's attempting to hack a pathway through a dense jungle, snarl of weeds, vines, trees and undergrowth.

[Text. A wise quote of John Archibald Wheeler, which says "We live on an island surrounded by a sea of ignorance. As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance."]
But the scientist’s jungle consists of natural ignorance and also a lack of knowledge and grown false beliefs, which may be long time officially accepted misconceptions.

[An old black and white image of two scientist with their fridge-sized metallic machines. Scientists are looking their machines curiously.]
Real scientists try to produce hypotheses, that is to say logical descriptions of real things and how they interact.

[A comic style scientist with a list of requirements for scientific hypotheses]
All scientific hypotheses of course have to be testable.
If it can't be actively tested, a hypothesis at least must pass the so-called test of time.

[Images of false pop-science articles at websites]
Incoming new data has to fit comfortably into any proposed hypothesis or model without too much tinkering with it, or massive back-to-the-drawing board modifications, and certainly without inventing imaginary ecological, non-measurable forces and non-observable entities, such as strange matter to explain the new data.

[Informative image explaining Birkeland currents with arrows and text]
In the past few years I’ve been studying Birkeland Currents.
Those are the strong, stable flows of electrically charged particles, that connect from one place in the cosmos to another.

What their form and structure is and how they affect objects they connect with.

[Image of auroras]
They deliver the electric power that lights up our auroras and I wanted to develop an accurate, realistic model of their structure.

[Image of the host and his book: Donald E. Scott, PhD, Electrical Engineer, Author, with the book "Interconnected Cosmos"]
A complete description of what I did is thoroughly detailed in chapters 10 and 11 of my latest book “The Interconnected Cosmos,” published by Stickman on Stone, and I urge you to pick up a copy.
Anyway, here's a brief description of what I did.

[Video of going fast through galaxy, between stars and looking backwards]
My starting point was at the edge of the scientific jungle, astrophysics and cosmology, which supposedly is the scientific study of cosmic space and those things that inhabit it, but it really is a jungle of contradictions and warped, bizarre, impossible processes and imaginary forces.

[A digital art image of unknown planets and a star]
But I had to begin somewhere.

[Screenshot of a scientific paper "Birkeland Currents: A Force-Free Field-Aligned Model"]
At that time I had completed the derivation and interpretation of a mathematical model that had been started by Stig Lundquist in 1950.

[A close screenshot of a important chapter of the scientific paper "Birkeland Currents: A Force-Free Field-Aligned Model"]
He had determined two equations that describe the basic shape of the magnetic field that is inside a Birkeland Current, but that's where he stopped.

[Even closer screenshot of math equations]
I completed his model to include five major equations and also interpreted what they implied about the physical shape of the Birkeland Currents and their behavior and that was not explained fully by Lundquist.

[Informative schematic-styled 3D animation of cross section of Birkeland current]
My model predicted that Birkeland Currents uniquely produce coaxial counter-rotational motion of their internal plasma and are able to carry electric current in both directions at the same time.
Let me emphasize, this is a unique behavior.
A coaxial cable here on Earth cannot simultaneously carry current in both directions.

[Informative 2D image of cross-section of counter rotating circles]
As far as we know, true coaxial counter rotation is created in nature only by field aligned, that is to say, Birkeland Currents.

[Image of two tornadoes near each other]
For example a pair of tornadoes, located near each other, rotating in opposite directions, is not an example of coaxial counter-rotation simply because they're not coaxial, they're not inside one another.

[Images of coaxial counter-rotating cloud bands on both Jupiter and Saturn]
So when NASA recorded those coaxial counter-rotating cloud bands on both Jupiter and Saturn, my model had passed its first test.

[Image of the host author]
That was the extent of my first foray into this cosmological jungle and at that point I figured we’d pitch camp for a rest.

[Screenshot of a scientific article: "Stellar counter-rotation in lenticular galaxy NGC 448", and graphs in it]
But then the announcement of the discovery of counter-rotating stars in the faces of several spiral galaxies, was even stronger evidence that was headed in the right direction.

[Visualization of stars in galaxy and lines between stars]
In 2014 it was reported that a vast network of plasma filaments, Birkeland Currents really, had been discovered that connect many, if not all, the galaxies in the
[Image of a cosmic web, a 3D cube-sized section of universe, which contains galaxies and electric filaments between them]
Universe in what has been called the Intergalactic Web, abbreviation IGW.

[Screenshot of a popular scientific article "Light from Ancient Quasar Reveleas Intergalatic Web" in the Scientific American magazine]
The discovery was quickly confirmed and a rush of scientific papers followed.
All this strongly suggested that Birkeland Currents not only connect objects within our solar system,
[3D cad-like image of few dozen galaxies]
but there are much larger and stronger Birkeland Currents arching across the vast distances between galaxies.

[A digital art image of galaxies and purple space dust]
I assume that those galaxies within the Intergalactic Web must be sending and receiving electric currents via the plasma filaments to which they are connected.

[A digital art image of galaxies and plasma filaments between them]
Also, I thought if galaxies actually form on those Birkeland Current filaments in the web, they probably inherit their rotational profiles from those filaments.

[A digital art image of yellow galaxies and blue plasma filaments between them]
If that happens, then the stellar velocity profiles ought to be the same as the velocity profiles of the Birkeland Currents on which they form.

[An image of a galaxy with a rotational velocity graph drawn on top of it showing that the velocity is the most high in the middle radius, which is wrong settled science]
Remember that the typical stellar velocity profile in a galaxy, a plot of the star's velocity as a function of its radius r, how far out it is from the galaxy's center, has been totally baffling to astrophysicists.

[Screenshot of a 2D graph showing velocity shift]
Actually they typically look like a plot of the function the square root of r.
This shape cannot be explained by Newtonian physics and almost all astrophysicists deny that electrical effects could possibly produce any of what we see in the cosmos.

[A black and white image of Vera Rubin using her microscope]
So, that's why astronomers like Vera Rubin and her colleagues postulated the existence of dark missing matter in the 1940s.

[Another image of a galaxy with a rotational velocity graph drawn on top of it. This time it shows both measured and calculated]
Their repeated unsuccessful attempts to explain this rotation of those stars is what set astronomers off on their decades-old quest to find dark matter.

[A video clip of the host talking at Electric Universe 2015 conference]
So, I wondered if the plot of the rotation speed of the plasma in my model Birkeland Current, might be similar to the ones that baffled those astronomers.
I set out to determine what that velocity profile might be.

[Informative schematic-styled 3D animation of cross section of Birkeland current]
My model yields information about the magnetic field strength and the current density in a Birkeland Current, but it doesn't directly yield any information about the velocity of the charges that make up those currents.

[White text against black background which says same what is in the script]
The key to determining the velocity of the stream of charged particles in a Birkeland Current was the realization that the current density in any plasma has two components, the charge density and the velocity of those charges.
The charge density is how much charge you have per cubic meter and the velocity of course is how many meters per second does that box of charges travel with.

[White text against black background which continues explaining the math]
Therefore, if we know any two of these three quantities j, rho and v, we can find the third one.

[Another image of a galaxy with a rotational velocity graph drawn on top of it. This time it shows both observed and expected]
We obviously know from historical astronomical observations what the typical velocity profile of stars within the galaxy looks like, and it's approximately the square root of r.

[White text against black background which has all math in it at once]
And we know from the equations of my model that the current density j, varies with radial distance r, out from the BC's, that is the Birkeland Current's central axis, as one over the square root of r.
So, I was able to solve for the third quantity, not very hard, the charge density rho that must exist inside my model BC,
[Black graph over black background, which was seen previously]
using all this data, the data from galaxy NGC1620, it turns out to be a simple inverse relationship, one over r.

[Screenshot of a 2d graph with Colombs per unit volume y-axis and radial distance x-axis]
This clearly demonstrates that an electrical process exists, that can produce the heretofore inexplicable stellar velocities,
[Another image of a galaxy with a rotational velocity graph drawn on top of it. This time it separates datapoints from starlight and from 21cm hydrogen]
that prompted astronomers to search for dark matter in the first place.

[Blue-yellow image of a galaxy]
In other words, the refusal to accept the existence and effects of electrical charges in space, is what began, and maintains to this day, the dark matter wild goose chase.

[Screenshot of a 2d graph with Colombs per unit volume y-axis and radial distance x-axis]
But is there any evidence that this particular distribution, this one over r shape, is the way charge really is distributed inside an actual BC?

[Image of the host author]
I took a short side trip off the logical journey we had been on, to find that out.
Did the velocity profiles of other galaxies also require this same charge density in the BC’s they connected with?
That was the question.

Other galaxies may have slightly different velocity
profiles. Using any of those other velocity

profiles with the same expression for
current density from my model, yielded

slightly different charge density curves.
But the main point is that there is

always some charge density curve, that will
exactly reproduce any arbitrary velocity profile.

So, I repeat myself. We have now shown, and as I said
recently, presented in a greater detail in my new

book, that a purely electrical process does
indeed exist that can produce a hitherto

inexplicable stellar velocity [distribution] that
prompted astronomers to search for dark

matter. And that's the end of the story.
The charge densities may be slightly

different from that one over r-shaped
distribution in different galaxies but

the BC curve, that Birkeland Current velocity
curve will always match the actual one.

By the way we know that BCs often show
coaxial counter-rotation. So, when we

observe coaxial rotation of the stars in
a galaxy that is connected to a BC,

that's additional evidence that we're
correct that it is the Birkeland Current

that's producing the velocity of those
stars in those galaxies. The twisting

motions of the galaxy's Birkeland current are
what produces the velocities of those stars.

If we assume that the charge density
distribution that exists within a

typical Birkeland Current filament is, as
a function of radial distance r, the

distance out from the Z-axis of the
Birkeland Current, is proportional to one

over r, as it is for the one particular
galaxy I show there, NGC1620, we can

solve mathematically for the electric
field that particular charge density

plot creates. In other words, we know what
the charges are, where they are, we can

solve for the electrical field that results.
In turn, knowing the properties of that

electric field, allows us to find the
voltage that will occur at every point

within the Birkeland Current's cross-section as
a function of the radius value of that point.

It turns out that under this assumption
about the charge density, that the

maximum voltage occurs exactly at the
center of the Birkeland Current, that r

equals 0, the central Z-axis. Out
from there, the points of increasing

radius, the voltage plot is a simple
linearly decreasing function of r.

This voltage distribution is exactly what's
needed to produce Marklund convection.

Okay, but so what? What's Marklund
convection? Well, in Marklund convection,

it's a process that occurs in a Birkeland
Current, atoms of the various elements present

are sorted according to their so-called ionization
potential. This results in the easily ionized, that

is to say the heavier atomic weight
elements such as iron, being found at the

center of the filament, and the lighter
elements such as hydrogen and helium,

being found in its outer regions. This
process works, because positive ions

accelerate down the voltage drop that
starts at the center of the Birkeland

current, and ends at its outer edge.
They go faster and faster, until they

collide out at the edge of the Birkeland
Current with any matter, atoms, ions, dust,

any other stuff, and this releases heat.
Those collisions release heat. The

temperature is hottest at the collision site,
just at the Birkeland Current's edge. And

that's why the elements that are the
most difficult from which to strip off

an electron, such as hydrogen and helium, are found
out there. So the center of the Birkeland Current

is its coolest region and contains
the heavy elements such as iron,

and its outer edge is the hottest region
containing elements such as hydrogen.

This is intriguingly the same sorting
arrangement found in stars including our

Sun, which are formed in Z-pinches in Birkeland
Currents. Our Sun has a heavy concentration of

hydrogen at its outer surface.
Therefore, if the Sun was created at the

center of a pinch, such as a Birkeland
Current, then its center ought to be

relatively cool and its outer surface, the
photosphere should be quite hot and it is.

We know that the dark center of a
Sunspot, the umbra, is much cooler than

the surrounding photosphere and it's
a window into the inside of the Sun.

But the question still remained. Was
my assumption that the distribution of

electric charges, the charge density rho,
one over r, correct? Does it really occur?

The answer came when a noted astronomer,
professor Michael Merrifield of the

University of Nottingham, reported that the
outer rim of a galaxy, this one was NGC4550,

mysteriously had a collection of counter-
rotating, hydrogen-rich stars at its

periphery, at the edge of it. He complained
that there was no known way for this

to ever occur. His announcement
unintentionally provided supporting

evidence that I considered strong evidence,
for my claim that a Birkeland Current

had been, or was connected to this galaxy.
This might easily have been the cause,

not only of the hydrogen-rich collection
of stars along its edge, but also why

that band was counter-rotating with
respect to the other stars in NGC4550.

I assert that my assumption was thus
shown to be valid, at least in this

particular case. And once again, we
see that an electrical process is the

explanation that eludes all these expert
astrophysicists that still say yes, yes,

we know electricity exists in the cosmos but it doesn't
do anything. Well, the Sun's heliosphere is a node, a

pinch in a Birkeland Current. According
to our model, the only place in a

Birkeland Current that involves energy
loss, would be the outer edge of the

Birkeland Current where positive
ions falling radially down that linearly

decreasing voltage profile, recombine
with electrons just outside. This

recombination process will emit a
low level of visible light. It releases

energy in the form of light. The newly
formed energetic neutral atoms called

ENAs, energetic neutral atoms, then
diffuse back into the Birkeland Current.

Being neutral, they're unaffected by any
of the electromagnetic effects there.

This visible light was discovered by the
NASA Lockheed Martin IBEX mission. The

announcement said in part, IBEX's
all-sky map of energetic neutral

atom emission reveals a bright ring of
ENAs that encircles the entire heliosphere.

David J. McComas, IBEX principal
investigator and assistant vice

president of the Space Science and
Engineering division at Southwest

Research Institute, said quote,
”The IBEX results are truly remarkable,

with a narrow ribbon of bright details.
This is a shocking new result.

We had no idea this ribbon existed, or
what has created it. Our previous ideas

about the outer heliosphere are going to have to be
revised.” But if history is any guide, it will not

be revised. NASA and the astrophysics
power structure never admit they were

wrong about anything. We'll see what they do in
this case. In any event the Marklund convection

process may well be occurring all along
the vast length of the Birkeland Current

that extends on either side of our Sun's
heliosphere. And that Birkeland Current is not

visible from Earth, probably because it's
an aging normal Birkeland Current that

has a weaker charge density along its
length than will be found at the Z-pinch,

the heliopause, the heliosphere.
The current density will be weaker, the

plasma will therefore be in dark mode quite
likely, and I think it is, from observation,

and any light generated by recombination
along its periphery will be even weaker

than that observed by the IBEX mission.
But the Marklund convection process, in

which the positive ions inside a Birkeland
Current are accelerated outward,

directed by an E-field from a high-voltage
central axis, is exactly the same process

that we now know occurs just above the
edge of the Sun's heliosphere, when the

solar wind positive ions coming from the
Sun recombine with incoming electrons to

produce the light seen by IBEX. It's
also similar to what happens just

above the Sun's photosphere, where
accelerating positive ions, escaping from

inside the Sun, collide with other matter,
which creates the high temperatures of

the Sun's coronal temperature anomaly.
It's the same process, just with higher

current density at the pinch than
along the BC's length, and highest

of all just above the Sun's photosphere.
So, the evidence strongly indicates that

stars are connected to their planets
and to other stars. All galaxies are

connected. The more we look carefully,
the entire Universe is interconnected by

plasma Birkeland Current filaments.
And the electrical interactions at all

locations are fairly similar, just with
differing strengths and sizes. The

process seems to be scalable. I have
long wondered why cosmologists,

who claim the Universe is created by a
Big Bang explosion, never try to explain

where all the rotation comes from.
Just about everything we see in the

cosmos rotates, or twists, or spins. Why?
How did it get that way from a Big Bang explosion?

Birkeland Currents rotate and they counter-
rotate. Is that the source of all the rotation?

I claim yes, it is. At least until I hear of another
natural process that can cause the rotation and

coaxial counter-rotation we see
everywhere we look in the sky.

We all have to realize that no one can ever disprove
the existence of something that doesn't exist.

In order to maintain or renew
the sources of their grant funding,

astrophysicists who now refuse to put
an end to their fruitless and wildly

expensive dark matter quest, are
challenging us to do just that. In

maintaining their assertion that dark matter
still exists, they're saying something like,

”There's a big vicious dog under this
table. He's invisible, untouchable,

unsmellable and makes no sounds, but he ate my
homework last night. Prove to me he doesn't exist.”

Now, this is a dishonest, illogical
unreasonable, childish challenge.

Anyone seriously making such a demand is
a shyster, a snake oil salesman who is

intentionally trying to swindle his audience, or
perhaps he's an intellectually lazy astrophysicist

fearing misinformation. Either way, the evidence is
indisputable. The theory and most importantly, the

rationale for the existence of dark matter
has now been systematically debunked.

An accurate understanding of the
cosmos is impossible in the conventional

science of astrophysics, simply because
they refuse to expand their tool set.

Limited to the force of gravity in
either its Newtonian or Einsteinian

format, gravity only attracts. Magnetic
forces can attract, but they can also repel.

Electrical forces can also attract and they can
repel. And then there's the Lorentz force that

exists between electrical charges moving through a
magnetic field. Including all of these essential forces

of nature when cracking the secrets of the Universe,

then the concept and necessity
of dark matter is outright ridiculous.

Another key difference between the Standard Model
and the Electric Universe model of cosmology.
