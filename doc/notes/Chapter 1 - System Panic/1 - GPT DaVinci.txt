Summarization of the script:

In this Sky Scholar video lecture, the host discusses the work of Professor Paris Herouni and his antenna in Armenia. The professor's antenna proves that there was no Big Bang, as the Penzias and Wilson's microwave background radiation could not have been produced by a primordial explosion. The antenna was located far from the oceans and detected no signal from the sky, showing that the 3 Kelvin temperature was not real. The host then discusses the WMAP and Planck satellites, and the COBE Ferris Horn, showing that none of them could measure the Penzias and Wilson monopole. Finally, the host encourages viewers to support the project to restore and save the antenna, and to spread the word about the results of this antenna, which could usher in a new dawn in astrophysics.

Summarization of the script as a short section in a another documentary video:

Professor Paris Herouni's antenna in Armenia has proved to the world, that there was no Big Bang. His antenna detected no signal from the sky, showing that the 3 Kelvin temperature was not real. Support is needed to restore and save this antenna, to usher in a new dawn in astrophysics.
