Summarization of the script:

In this video, host Sky Scholar marks the 3rd anniversary of his channel by starting a series of 10 videos challenging the claim that the Cosmic Microwave Background provides direct proof of the Big Bang. He speaks about how bad science has been used to support a religious concept, and how cosmologists have extrapolated their own unknowing claims to propagate this theory. He then outlines the topics he will cover in the upcoming videos, such as the measurements of the monopole, the anisotropy maps, water and Kirchoff’s law, and the results of the WMAP, COBE and Planck satellites. He encourages viewers to watch his previous videos, and support his channel.

"The Cosmic Microwave Background - A Closer Look"

Summarization of the script as a short section without the original subject "Sky Scholar":

This video series challenges the claim that the Cosmic Microwave Background provides direct proof of the Big Bang. It examines how bad science has been used to support a religious concept, and speaks about the measurements of the monopole, the anisotropy maps, water and Kirchoff’s law, and the results of the WMAP, COBE and Planck satellites. It encourages viewers to watch previous videos and support the channel.

Summarization with the emphasis on the scientific conundrum and without the original subject "Sky Scholar":
