### The Cosmic Microwave Background - A Closer Look
This video series challenges the claim that the Cosmic Microwave Background provides direct proof of the Big Bang. It examines how bad science has been used to support a religious concept, and speaks about the measurements of the monopole, the anisotropy maps, water and Kirchoff’s law, and the results of the WMAP, COBE and Planck satellites.

### Debunking Dark Matter: The Evidence for Birkeland Currents
Birkeland Currents offer an alternative explanation to the failed attempts of astronomers to explain the rotational velocity of stars in galaxies through Newtonian physics. Additionally, the model provides evidence for the existence of an intergalactic web of plasma filaments connecting galaxies across vast distances. The process of Marklund Convection, which is a process that sorts atoms according to their ionization potential, is also seen in stars, including our Sun. All of this evidence suggests that the electrical interactions are responsible for all the rotation, debunking the concept and necessity of dark matter.

### Unveiling the Cosmic Z-Pinch: Exploring the Birth of Stars and Planets
A new scientific study suggests that planet formation may occur much faster than previously thought. Astronomers have been puzzled by the lack of planet-forming dust in star systems, and the team behind the study proposes that a sufficient amount of dust arises surprisingly early in a star's life. In recent years, scientific discovery has also forced a similar crisis on the question of how stars form. The Electric Universe and plasma cosmology propose that the electromagnetic phenomenon called the Z-pinch is a dominant organizational phenomenon in the cosmos, and Wal Thornhill has proposed that planets also form electromagnetically, often along the same current filaments on which stars form. The pairing of filaments can concentrate matter in toroids and closely orbiting bodies, and the weird zoo of exoplanetary systems has only affirmed the astounding failure of gravitational accretion theory to explain science discovery. The Electric Universe and plasma cosmology have made successful predictions and are worthy of sober scientific investigation.

### Discovering the Electric Universe: How Stars Are Formed by the Z-Pinch Process
Recent scientific findings have revealed that gravitational cavities do not play their expected role in quenching the growth of a star. The Snake Nebula provides dramatic evidence of stars forming along filaments and the Herschel space observatory has provided fine images of filaments glowing from the light of electric currents - debunking the idea of explosions. All of this evidence points to the power of the electromagnetic Z-pinch in forming stars.

### Re-Examining the Moon: Exploring a Radical Reassessment of Our Solar System
The Moon has been an object of mystery since the dawn of the space age, and a recent scientific paper has added to its list of puzzles. Analysis of the Apollo asteroid Kamo’oalewa, which shares Earth's orbit around the Sun, shows that it has a spectrum remarkably similar to that of rocks from the Moon, suggesting that it may have broken off the Moon as the result of a kinetic impact. However, the Electric Universe hypothesis proposes that the Moon's heavily cratered surface was not produced by periodic impacts, but rather from interplanetary electrical discharge in a relatively recent epoch of planetary instability. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of high concentrations of carbon ions on the Moon, an abundance that cannot be explained by the traditional impact origin of the Moon. Additionally, the supposed "impact crater" South Pole-Aitken basin does not contain the expected minerals, and the sinuous rilles on the Moon cannot be explained by flowing lava or water. All of this evidence suggests that the Moon may have been born relatively recently by electrical discharge, and has been the product of electrical scarring.

### Reverse Engineering the Earth: Exploring the Patterns of Nature with Electric Forces
In this chapter, we explored the Electric Earth theory which suggests that electrical forces shape the planet and its surroundings. We looked at the patterns of charge diffusion and how it forms circuits, and how planetary bodies respond to high potentials. We also explored how mountains can form from supersonic plasma winds, with evidence of tetrahedral shapes and pillow rocks. Finally, we looked at an example of a monolithic granite tetrahedron to further explore the electric earth theory.

### Unlocking the Mysteries of the Universe: An Introduction to the Particle Model
In this documentary, we explore a new model of the universe. This particle model explains physical phenomena such as electricity, magnetism, gravity, optics, space, time, inertia and energy through interactions between three basic particle quanta and a handful of rules. We examine how this model can be used to understand the observed universe and why it is important to keep an open mind to the idea that reality can be described in many ways.

### Unlocking Morton Spears' Particle Quanta: Exploring the Subatomic World.
Morton Spears proposed a simpler alternative to standard particle physics. His model is made up of three indestructible particle quanta: one negatively charged, one positively charged, and one neutral. The proton is made up of 1089 positive quanta and 1088 negative quanta, and the neutron is made up of 1090 positive and 1090 negative quanta. The electron is made up of 2 negative quanta and 1 positive quantum, and the neutrino is made up of a single neutral quantum. The strong force that binds atomic nuclei is explained in terms of texture, and the photon is made of an equal number of positive and negative charge quanta in a closed state.

### Exploring Electron-Positron Pair Production and Sticky Light: Uncovering the Physics of 4 Stable Subatomic Particles
Electron-positron pair production is a phenomenon in which gamma-ray photons spontaneously produce electron-positron pairs when in close proximity of massive atomic nuclei. This can be explained as a transformation of the photon itself. Photons are made up of 3 positive and 3 negative quanta and can be transformed into inertial matter through physical manipulations. Furthermore, a recent discovery at MIT suggests that photons can stick together into pairs and triplets when passed through a cloud of ultracold rubidium atoms, thereby forming structures with mass. Of the six particles described, only four are stable: protons, electrons, photons and neutrinos.

### Unraveling the Mystery of the Bouncing Electron: The Aether of Zero-Point Particles
At the subatomic level, an electron is trapped in a constant state of bouncing off a proton. Electron clouds are manifestations of this, and their energy states are determined by the resonant frequencies allowed by the nucleus. Chemical bonds are formed when electrons find ways to bounce off more than one nucleus at a time, such as in the case of hydrogen molecules. Every time atoms combine, energy is released. This energy is carried by photons, but there must be an aether made up of undetectable particles in order for this process to work. This aether is made up of zero-point photons and neutrinos, and its constantly vibrating at a high frequency.

### Explaining the Electric Force Using Zero-Point Neutrinos
The electric force can be explained entirely in terms of zero-point neutrinos. When a neutrino hits an object with a charge, it carries a footprint of the charge with it and creates a low or high pressure in the aether depending on the charge of the neutrino. Neutral bodies also experience attraction to charged surfaces due to the distortion of the distribution of charges. Coulomb's law can be explained in terms of the probability of collisions between charged neutrinos, which is related to the product of the two charges, and the availability of zero-point neutrinos.

### Uncovering the Mystery of Gravity and Anti-Gravity
Gravity is an imbalance in the electric force that produces a weak attracting force between neutral bodies. This explains why the formula for Newton's universal law of gravity is so similar to Coulomb's law. Anti-gravity is the opposite of gravity and manifests itself as a high pressure in the regions away from the gravitational field. Gravity and anti-gravity cannot be shielded from, as their effects daisy-chain out to other bodies.

### Exploring Electric Currents and Permanent Magnets through Zero-Point Photons
Electric current is the motion of charged particles, typically electrons, through a conducting wire. Every electric current generates a magnetic field around it, which can be explained in terms of zero-point photons being polarized and set spinning. Permanent magnets are pieces of metal, usually iron, which have a permanent magnetic field associated with them. This field is caused by the atoms of the metal hooking onto one side of nearby zero-point photons more readily than the other side.

### Understanding Electric Currents Through the Faraday Effect
Electric currents can be explained by the Faraday Effect, which shows that there is a direct relationship between magnetism and light. Magnetic fields fan out to the side, producing high and low pressure areas in the aether, and producing repelling or attracting forces. Different materials react differently to magnetic fields, and ferromagnetic materials can be induced with a permanent magnetic field, allowing them to be used for electric currents.

### The Power of Induction: How Magnets Create Electric Currents
This documentary video explores the power of induction, or the ability of magnets to create electric currents in wires. Using the right-hand rule of electromagnetism and the properties of polarized photons, this video explains how electric motors and generators work, how radio transmission is possible, and why Faraday cages can protect from electric and magnetic forces.

### Exploring the Size of Photons
In this documentary, we explore the size of photons and how it relates to their energy. We discuss the size of zero-point photons, radio-wave photons, visible light photons, x-rays, and gamma-rays, and how the size of these photons is related to their ability to pass through materials. We then use the slalom analogy to explain the phenomenon of refraction and diffraction in optics and how Snell's law can be used as evidence to support the idea that light is a particle and not a wave.

### The Double Slit Experiment: Exploring Wave-Like Properties of Matter
The double slit experiment has been used to prove that not just photons, but all matter has wave-like properties. Pilot Wave Theory can be used to explain these properties. Zero-point particles form a standing wave and when a particle is sent through space it bobs along on that wave. The larger the particle, the less affected it is by the wave and the tighter the pattern observed at the detector. Neutrinos, photons, and gravity also influence the behavior of particles observed in the double slit experiment.

### The Mystery of Red-Shifted Light
Light from distant bodies is often red-shifted, meaning that it appears to be shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. This phenomenon has been used to infer that our universe is expanding, but could there be other explanations? This video looks at different theories, such as the tired light hypothesis and intrinsic red-shift, which suggest that the red-shift of light may be due to a loss of energy as photons are travelling through the universe, or due to the fact that young matter has less mass than older matter.

### How Mass Condensation Explains the Unusual Fossil Records
Mass condensation is an interesting hypothesis that suggests that matter is becoming more massive over time. This process is driven by photons crashing into already existing matter, thereby increasing its mass. The fossil records show evidence of creatures that would be impossible in today's environment, due to the increased mass and gravity. This suggests that both inertia and gravity have increased over time, exactly as hypothesized by Halton Arp.

### Exploring the Proton-Electron Atom and the Possibilities of Transmutations
This document explores the proton-electron atom model and how it can explain radioactivity and transmutations such as nuclear fusion and fission. It also examines the concept of antimatter and how it can be explained by the same model. This model suggests that mass condensation onto the proton is the cause of radioactivity, and that transmutations can be achieved through the consumption or shedding of protons, electrons, or positrons.

### Hollow Planets - Exploring the Possibility of Our Planet's Structure
This article explores the possibility that our planet Earth is hollow, and that this hollow structure could explain various phenomena such as gravity anomalies, the expansion of our planet, and the origin of water in the oceans. It argues that the potential difference between the ionosphere and the surface of the planet, combined with the possibility of a repelling electrical force at its centre, make a hollow structure a plausible option. Additionally, seismic evidence and NASA's measurements of Jupiter's core density suggest that hollow planets are indeed possible. Finally, the article proposes that the gravitational force is not only dependent on mass, but also on the electrical environment in which the force is made.

### Discovering the Stabilizing Force Behind Orbits
This documentary highlights the importance of electric repulsion to the stability of orbits. It explains how electric repulsion works to keep our Moon and other astronomic bodies in stable orbits, and how it explains the circular shape of impact craters and the synthesis of water in comets. It also explains the consequences of rogue planets entering a solar system, and how electrical repulsion is the force that ultimately determines whether the rogue planet is captured or ejected.

### The Mystery of the Rogue Planet: Uncovering the Secrets of Valles Marineris
Have you ever wondered why Mars has a massive scar across its surface? In this documentary, we uncover the secrets of Valles Marineris and explore the possibility that a rogue planet once roamed our solar system. We look at the evidence of the damage it caused on Mars, the Grand Canyon, and the asteroid belt, and hypothesize that the rogue planet was in fact Jupiter's daughter Venus.

### The Electric Universe: A New Perspective
This book explores the idea that electricity is the driving force behind the universe, rather than gravity as is commonly believed. It examines the evidence for electric plasma currents in space, and suggests that supernovas are the births of stars and planets, rather than their deaths. It further suggests that our Sun is powered by electricity, and that stars are simply large planets with thick mineral-rich atmospheres. Lastly, it proposes a life-cycle of matter, which solves the problem of heat death through entropy. Together, these ideas offer a new perspective on the universe and its workings.

### The Eternal Universe: Exploring an Alternative Model of Physics
This book explores an alternative model of physics in which electricity, rather than gravity, is the main force in the universe. It proposes that distance is a relative measure of inertial matter, energy is stored as size in subatomic particles, and time slows down for particles with increased energy. The book also explains the Mercury Anomaly, the neutrino that appears when a free neutron decays, and the idea that the universe is an eternal ecosystem with no start and no end.
