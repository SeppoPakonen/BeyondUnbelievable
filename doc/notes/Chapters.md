### The Cosmic Microwave Background - A Closer Look
This video series challenges the claim that the Cosmic Microwave Background provides direct proof of the Big Bang. It examines how bad science has been used to support a religious concept, and speaks about the measurements of the monopole, the anisotropy maps, water and Kirchoff’s law, and the results of the WMAP, COBE and Planck satellites.

### Debunking Dark Matter: The Evidence for Birkeland Currents
Birkeland Currents offer an alternative explanation to the failed attempts of astronomers to explain the rotational velocity of stars in galaxies through Newtonian physics. Additionally, the model provides evidence for the existence of an intergalactic web of plasma filaments connecting galaxies across vast distances. The process of Marklund Convection, which is a process that sorts atoms according to their ionization potential, is also seen in stars, including our Sun. All of this evidence suggests that the electrical interactions are responsible for all the rotation, debunking the concept and necessity of dark matter.

### Unveiling the Cosmic Z-Pinch: Exploring the Birth of Stars and Planets
A new scientific study suggests that planet formation may occur much faster than previously thought. Astronomers have been puzzled by the lack of planet-forming dust in star systems, and the team behind the study proposes that a sufficient amount of dust arises surprisingly early in a star's life. In recent years, scientific discovery has also forced a similar crisis on the question of how stars form. The Electric Universe and plasma cosmology propose that the electromagnetic phenomenon called the Z-pinch is a dominant organizational phenomenon in the cosmos, and Wal Thornhill has proposed that planets also form electromagnetically, often along the same current filaments on which stars form. The pairing of filaments can concentrate matter in toroids and closely orbiting bodies, and the weird zoo of exoplanetary systems has only affirmed the astounding failure of gravitational accretion theory to explain science discovery. The Electric Universe and plasma cosmology have made successful predictions and are worthy of sober scientific investigation.

### Discovering the Electric Universe: How Stars Are Formed by the Z-Pinch Process
Recent scientific findings have revealed that gravitational cavities do not play their expected role in quenching the growth of a star. The Snake Nebula provides dramatic evidence of stars forming along filaments and the Herschel space observatory has provided fine images of filaments glowing from the light of electric currents - debunking the idea of explosions. All of this evidence points to the power of the electromagnetic Z-pinch in forming stars.

### Re-Examining the Moon: Exploring a Radical Reassessment of Our Solar System
The Moon has been an object of mystery since the dawn of the space age, and a recent scientific paper has added to its list of puzzles. Analysis of the Apollo asteroid Kamo’oalewa, which shares Earth's orbit around the Sun, shows that it has a spectrum remarkably similar to that of rocks from the Moon, suggesting that it may have broken off the Moon as the result of a kinetic impact. However, the Electric Universe hypothesis proposes that the Moon's heavily cratered surface was not produced by periodic impacts, but rather from interplanetary electrical discharge in a relatively recent epoch of planetary instability. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of high concentrations of carbon ions on the Moon, an abundance that cannot be explained by the traditional impact origin of the Moon. Additionally, the supposed "impact crater" South Pole-Aitken basin does not contain the expected minerals, and the sinuous rilles on the Moon cannot be explained by flowing lava or water. All of this evidence suggests that the Moon may have been born relatively recently by electrical discharge, and has been the product of electrical scarring.

### Reverse Engineering the Earth: Exploring the Patterns of Nature with Electric Forces
In this chapter, we explored the Electric Earth theory which suggests that electrical forces shape the planet and its surroundings. We looked at the patterns of charge diffusion and how it forms circuits, and how planetary bodies respond to high potentials. We also explored how mountains can form from supersonic plasma winds, with evidence of tetrahedral shapes and pillow rocks. Finally, we looked at an example of a monolithic granite tetrahedron to further explore the electric earth theory.

## Chapter 3: Einstein, we have a problem

### Unlocking the Mysteries of the Universe: An Introduction to the Particle Model
In this documentary, we explore a new model of the universe. This particle model explains physical phenomena such as electricity, magnetism, gravity, optics, space, time, inertia and energy through interactions between three basic particle quanta and a handful of rules. We examine how this model can be used to understand the observed universe and why it is important to keep an open mind to the idea that reality can be described in many ways.

### Unlocking Morton Spears' Particle Quanta: Exploring the Subatomic World.
Morton Spears proposed a simpler alternative to standard particle physics. His model is made up of three indestructible particle quanta: one negatively charged, one positively charged, and one neutral. The proton is made up of 1089 positive quanta and 1088 negative quanta, and the neutron is made up of 1090 positive and 1090 negative quanta. The electron is made up of 2 negative quanta and 1 positive quantum, and the neutrino is made up of a single neutral quantum. The strong force that binds atomic nuclei is explained in terms of texture, and the photon is made of an equal number of positive and negative charge quanta in a closed state.

### Exploring Electron-Positron Pair Production and Sticky Light: Uncovering the Physics of 4 Stable Subatomic Particles
Electron-positron pair production is a phenomenon in which gamma-ray photons spontaneously produce electron-positron pairs when in close proximity of massive atomic nuclei. This can be explained as a transformation of the photon itself. Photons are made up of 3 positive and 3 negative quanta and can be transformed into inertial matter through physical manipulations. Furthermore, a recent discovery at MIT suggests that photons can stick together into pairs and triplets when passed through a cloud of ultracold rubidium atoms, thereby forming structures with mass. Of the six particles described, only four are stable: protons, electrons, photons and neutrinos.

### Unraveling the Mystery of the Bouncing Electron: The Aether of Zero-Point Particles
At the subatomic level, an electron is trapped in a constant state of bouncing off a proton. Electron clouds are manifestations of this, and their energy states are determined by the resonant frequencies allowed by the nucleus. Chemical bonds are formed when electrons find ways to bounce off more than one nucleus at a time, such as in the case of hydrogen molecules. Every time atoms combine, energy is released. This energy is carried by photons, but there must be an aether made up of undetectable particles in order for this process to work. This aether is made up of zero-point photons and neutrinos, and its constantly vibrating at a high frequency.

### Explaining the Electric Force Using Zero-Point Neutrinos
The electric force can be explained entirely in terms of zero-point neutrinos. When a neutrino hits an object with a charge, it carries a footprint of the charge with it and creates a low or high pressure in the aether depending on the charge of the neutrino. Neutral bodies also experience attraction to charged surfaces due to the distortion of the distribution of charges. Coulomb's law can be explained in terms of the probability of collisions between charged neutrinos, which is related to the product of the two charges, and the availability of zero-point neutrinos.

### Uncovering the Mystery of Gravity and Anti-Gravity
Gravity is an imbalance in the electric force that produces a weak attracting force between neutral bodies. This explains why the formula for Newton's universal law of gravity is so similar to Coulomb's law. Anti-gravity is the opposite of gravity and manifests itself as a high pressure in the regions away from the gravitational field. Gravity and anti-gravity cannot be shielded from, as their effects daisy-chain out to other bodies.

### Exploring Electric Currents and Permanent Magnets through Zero-Point Photons
Electric current is the motion of charged particles, typically electrons, through a conducting wire. Every electric current generates a magnetic field around it, which can be explained in terms of zero-point photons being polarized and set spinning. Permanent magnets are pieces of metal, usually iron, which have a permanent magnetic field associated with them. This field is caused by the atoms of the metal hooking onto one side of nearby zero-point photons more readily than the other side.
[Source (4 pages)](https://www.universeofparticles.com/electric-currents/)


### Understanding Electric Currents Through the Faraday Effect
Electric currents can be explained by the Faraday Effect, which shows that there is a direct relationship between magnetism and light. Magnetic fields fan out to the side, producing high and low pressure areas in the aether, and producing repelling or attracting forces. Different materials react differently to magnetic fields, and ferromagnetic materials can be induced with a permanent magnetic field, allowing them to be used for electric currents.

### The Power of Induction: How Magnets Create Electric Currents
This documentary video explores the power of induction, or the ability of magnets to create electric currents in wires. Using the right-hand rule of electromagnetism and the properties of polarized photons, this video explains how electric motors and generators work, how radio transmission is possible, and why Faraday cages can protect from electric and magnetic forces.

### Exploring the Size of Photons
In this documentary, we explore the size of photons and how it relates to their energy. We discuss the size of zero-point photons, radio-wave photons, visible light photons, x-rays, and gamma-rays, and how the size of these photons is related to their ability to pass through materials. We then use the slalom analogy to explain the phenomenon of refraction and diffraction in optics and how Snell's law can be used as evidence to support the idea that light is a particle and not a wave.

### The Double Slit Experiment: Exploring Wave-Like Properties of Matter
The double slit experiment has been used to prove that not just photons, but all matter has wave-like properties. Pilot Wave Theory can be used to explain these properties. Zero-point particles form a standing wave and when a particle is sent through space it bobs along on that wave. The larger the particle, the less affected it is by the wave and the tighter the pattern observed at the detector. Neutrinos, photons, and gravity also influence the behavior of particles observed in the double slit experiment.

### The Mystery of Red-Shifted Light
Light from distant bodies is often red-shifted, meaning that it appears to be shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. This phenomenon has been used to infer that our universe is expanding, but could there be other explanations? This video looks at different theories, such as the tired light hypothesis and intrinsic red-shift, which suggest that the red-shift of light may be due to a loss of energy as photons are travelling through the universe, or due to the fact that young matter has less mass than older matter.
[Source (4 pages)](https://www.universeofparticles.com/red-shift-of-light/)

### How Mass Condensation Explains the Unusual Fossil Records
Mass condensation is an interesting hypothesis that suggests that matter is becoming more massive over time. This process is driven by photons crashing into already existing matter, thereby increasing its mass. The fossil records show evidence of creatures that would be impossible in today's environment, due to the increased mass and gravity. This suggests that both inertia and gravity have increased over time, exactly as hypothesized by Halton Arp.

### Exploring the Proton-Electron Atom and the Possibilities of Transmutations
This document explores the proton-electron atom model and how it can explain radioactivity and transmutations such as nuclear fusion and fission. It also examines the concept of antimatter and how it can be explained by the same model. This model suggests that mass condensation onto the proton is the cause of radioactivity, and that transmutations can be achieved through the consumption or shedding of protons, electrons, or positrons.

### Hollow Planets - Exploring the Possibility of Our Planet's Structure
This article explores the possibility that our planet Earth is hollow, and that this hollow structure could explain various phenomena such as gravity anomalies, the expansion of our planet, and the origin of water in the oceans. It argues that the potential difference between the ionosphere and the surface of the planet, combined with the possibility of a repelling electrical force at its centre, make a hollow structure a plausible option. Additionally, seismic evidence and NASA's measurements of Jupiter's core density suggest that hollow planets are indeed possible. Finally, the article proposes that the gravitational force is not only dependent on mass, but also on the electrical environment in which the force is made.

### Discovering the Stabilizing Force Behind Orbits
This documentary highlights the importance of electric repulsion to the stability of orbits. It explains how electric repulsion works to keep our Moon and other astronomic bodies in stable orbits, and how it explains the circular shape of impact craters and the synthesis of water in comets. It also explains the consequences of rogue planets entering a solar system, and how electrical repulsion is the force that ultimately determines whether the rogue planet is captured or ejected.

### The Mystery of the Rogue Planet: Uncovering the Secrets of Valles Marineris
Have you ever wondered why Mars has a massive scar across its surface? In this documentary, we uncover the secrets of Valles Marineris and explore the possibility that a rogue planet once roamed our solar system. We look at the evidence of the damage it caused on Mars, the Grand Canyon, and the asteroid belt, and hypothesize that the rogue planet was in fact Jupiter's daughter Venus.

### The Electric Universe: A New Perspective
This book explores the idea that electricity is the driving force behind the universe, rather than gravity as is commonly believed. It examines the evidence for electric plasma currents in space, and suggests that supernovas are the births of stars and planets, rather than their deaths. It further suggests that our Sun is powered by electricity, and that stars are simply large planets with thick mineral-rich atmospheres. Lastly, it proposes a life-cycle of matter, which solves the problem of heat death through entropy. Together, these ideas offer a new perspective on the universe and its workings.

### The Eternal Universe: Exploring an Alternative Model of Physics
This book explores an alternative model of physics in which electricity, rather than gravity, is the main force in the universe. It proposes that distance is a relative measure of inertial matter, energy is stored as size in subatomic particles, and time slows down for particles with increased energy. The book also explains the Mercury Anomaly, the neutrino that appears when a free neutron decays, and the idea that the universe is an eternal ecosystem with no start and no end.

## Chapter 4: Space based climate

### The Interaction Between Solar Activity and Climate Change
This section looks at the relationship between solar activity and climate change. It examines the flaws in climate science, the effects of different forms of solar energy on our atmosphere, the connections between solar activity and extreme weather events, and the evidence for a connection between solar activity and climate change. It also explores how space weather, solar wind speed, relativistic electron flux, and storminess can affect hurricanes and typhoons, and how the melting of ice at the poles can cause an ice age. Finally, it looks at the potential for a grand minimum this century, and the implications of this for the Earth's climate.
[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEWoPzaDmOA)

#### Part 1: The Major Flaws of Climate Science
In this part, Ben Davidson of Space Weather News explains the three major flaws of climate science that have a practical effect of rigging the studies to come out in one way. These flaws are related to the foundational level of all of the papers making up the 97%, and include the misrepresentation of the sun's influence on the upper atmosphere, the lack of understanding of the expanse of solar forcing, and the failure to account for electronmagnetic couplings.
[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEWoPzaDmOA)

#### Part 2: Solar Activity and Its Effects on Our Climate
This part looks at the effects of solar activity on our climate, discussing various forms of solar energy and how they interact with our atmosphere to create different weather patterns. It examines how ultraviolet and X-ray radiation, cosmic rays, the solar wind, and electromagnetic waves affect the polar vortex and jet streams, as well as the oscillation and circulation modulation of the ENSO and NAO patterns. It also looks at the connections between solar activity and extreme weather events, including the El Nino and La Nina patterns. Finally, it considers the evidence for a connection between solar activity and climate change, exploring the work of scientists such as Dr. Tinsley, Dr. Leslie Gray, and Ghido et al.
[14:31](https://youtu.be/rEWoPzaDmOA?t=871)

#### Part 3: Uncovering the Mysteries of Space Weather and Climate Change
Space weather has been known to affect climate change since the time of Benjamin Franklin's experiments on thunderstorms. In the last 24 months, researchers around the world have discovered that solar and cosmic particles interact with volcanic aerosols to influence climate patterns. By studying the global electric circuit, researchers are now able to understand how cloud formation is related to space weather and climate change.
[27:30](https://youtu.be/rEWoPzaDmOA?t=1649)

#### Part 4: Sun-Earth Interaction: How Solar Activity Affects Earth's Climate
In this part, Matt Kirkland and his student examine how solar wind speed, relativistic electron flux, and storminess vary across the boundaries between high speed and low solar wind speed sectors and magnetic sectors. Additionally, they discuss how solar activity can create and influence hurricanes and typhoons, and how the melting of ice at the poles can cause the oceans to become desalinated and chilled, resulting in an ice age. Finally, they conclude that while we must reduce pollution, we must also be aware of the flaws in the foundations of climate science, as the Sun is due for a grand minimum this century and the earth is heading back into an ice age.

### The Struggle Between Centralized and Decentralized Governance
- The struggle between centralized and decentralized governance is the ultimate contest.
- They possess a monopoly of information, which they leverage to deceive and suppress those who threaten their interests.
- Their ultimate goal is to create a convoluted and incomprehensible system, taking away the power of understanding from individuals.
- They strive to maintain a status quo which rejects the scaling of society and patterns, instead seeking to maintain a reactive posture.

### Deceitful Propaganda: Breaking Free of the Tested Lies that Steal Time
- Intelligent people may be able to recognize and escape the seemingly endless stream of false information
- Unsuspecting and unprepared individuals may fall prey to the same deceptive narratives, unable to warn others
- The concerning rise of systemic untruths and the theft of precious time should not be taken lightly.

### The Uphill Battle of Speaking Truth in a Society of Lies
In a society that is so full of lies that it is difficult for outsiders to come and speak truthfully there, people would be so accustomed to the lies that they would struggle to accept the truth. They would be suspicious of any outsider who tried speaking truthfully, and the outsider would be met with hostility and resistance. The outsider would be labeled as a troublemaker, disruptive to the status quo, and would likely be ostracized or even persecuted for speaking the truth. If the outsider did manage to speak truthfully, it is likely that their words would be twisted and manipulated to fit the narrative of the society, thus undermining the truth-teller’s efforts. In such a society, speaking truthfully would be an uphill battle, and it would be almost impossible for an outsider to successfully challenge the lies and false narratives that have been ingrained in the culture.


Winning strategies for individual in such societies:

1. Be patient and persistent. It will take time for people to come around to the truth, so be patient and continue to speak truthfully, even in the face of resistance.
2. Take a collaborative approach. Talk to people in the society and try to understand their perspectives. Explain the truth in a way that people can understand and relate to.
3. Find allies. Look for people who share similar values and perspectives, and work together to help spread the truth.
4. Educate and inspire. Use creative tactics to educate people and inspire them to see the value of truth.
5. Persevere. Don’t give up in the face of opposition. Continue to speak truthfully and stay committed to your cause.

### Leaks everywhere: Strategies for a Society with Unreliable Devices
Living in a society where everyone uses devices that aren't reliable when it comes to privacy can be quite disconcerting. People would feel like their personal information, conversations, and other sensitive data are completely exposed for the world to see. Companies, governments, and other entities would be able to access this data without the knowledge or consent of the user. This would lead to a lack of trust in the devices, as well as in the companies that provide them. Furthermore, people would be hesitant to use the devices for fear of their information being collected and used against them. The lack of privacy could lead to an atmosphere of fear and paranoia, as people would feel like their every move was being monitored and their data was being shared. Ultimately, this could lead to a breakdown in the social fabric of the society, as people would be unwilling to trust one another.

What's worse, people seem to become passive about the problem and create a culture where everything doesn't matter. People would be less inclined to follow the laws and regulations that are there to protect them and their data. This could lead to further issues, such as incorrect data being used for decision-making or malicious activity going unchecked. In short, having a society where everyone uses devices that aren't reliable when it comes to privacy can have serious consequences. It can lead to a breakdown in trust, an atmosphere of fear and paranoia, and a decrease in compliance with laws and regulations.

Winning strategies for individual in such societies:

1. Understand the Risks: It is important to be aware of the potential risks of using devices that are not reliable when it comes to privacy. Knowing the potential consequences of using such devices can help individuals make informed decisions about their own privacy and security.
2. Use Encryption: Encryption is a powerful tool that can help protect data from being accessed by unauthorized parties. Encryption can be used to protect sensitive data and communications, as well as to safeguard user data from being intercepted.
3. Limit Device Usage: Limiting the amount of data that is stored and shared on devices can help reduce the amount of data that is exposed. Individuals should also limit the number of devices they use, as each device can be a potential vulnerability.
4. Be Mindful of Third-Party Apps: Third-party apps can be a potential source of privacy issues, as they can be used to collect and share sensitive information. Individuals should be mindful of the apps they are using and the permissions they are granting.
5. Monitor Device Activity: Monitoring device activity can help individuals identify potential privacy issues. If suspicious activity is detected, individuals should take steps to protect their data from being accessed.

### Goverment controls
Snowden has leaked information about how a US secret project stores all people's communications and information in a secret database.
Essentially:
- government saves all Internet usage meta-data to separate database
- filtered communications are probably stored too
- data can be used as input to super AI training
[Source](https://blokt.com/guides/edward-snowden-leaks#PRISM)

#### Search results ar hacked
The search results for "content of snowden leaks" only show official defenses of the USA, and no shown flaws. Future generations will no longer be able to learn how much evil is involved when the tech giants collaborate with the US government.

#### Speculation of AI usage
The government can use artificial intelligence to reveal everything about an individual.
Conventional reasons why this is a bad thing:
- Invasion of privacy: People’s private information can be accessed without their consent or knowledge.
- Manipulation of data: The information that is collected can be manipulated and used to form false narratives.
- Big Brother mentality: People may feel that their privacy is not respected or that they are being monitored.
- Stifling of free speech: People may be less likely to express themselves online if they feel that their words could be used against them.
- Data security: With all of this data being collected and stored, there is a potential for hackers to gain access to it and use it for malicious purposes.

However, that's a small problem. Society and its attitudes can now be manipulated on a large scale, which reveals the following problems:
- Manipulation of public opinion: Governments and corporations can influence people's opinions without their knowledge.
- Arbitrary use of the tool by decision makers: The decisions made by decision makers can be based on biased information, which can lead to unfair or unjust decisions.
- Unethical use of personal data: Personal data can be used to target specific individuals for marketing or other purposes without their knowledge or consent.
- Unintended consequences: Because the technology is new and untested, there can be unintended consequences that are difficult to predict and manage.

##### for population analysing
Details of possible use of population analysis by deep government:
- Targeted surveillance: By analyzing data from internet searches and other sources, governments can identify individuals to target for surveillance.
- Predictive policing: By analyzing population trends, governments can use predictive policing to anticipate and prevent crime.
- Political manipulation: Governments can use population analysis to identify voting patterns and target their messaging to swing elections.
- Manipulation of public opinion: Governments can use population analysis to identify the public’s opinion on certain topics and then craft messaging to influence their views.
- Automated decision-making: Governments can use population analysis to automate decision-making in areas such as immigration, healthcare, and criminal justice.

##### for individual analysing
- Surveillance of individuals: Governments can use individual analysis to identify targets for surveillance.
- Tracking realtime life: Governments can track individuals in real time to monitor their activities and whereabouts.
- Behavioral profiling: Governments can use individual analysis to profile behavior and identify patterns in order to predict future behavior.

##### for population manipulation
- Social engineering: Governments can use population analysis to craft messaging and use it to manipulate public opinion.
- Targeted advertising: Governments can use population analysis to target individuals with specific ads in order to influence their decisions.
- Misinformation campaigns: Governments can use population analysis to spread false information or manipulate public opinion.

##### for individual manipulation
- The government can send subliminal messages through advertisements and through various signaling similar to hacking, which can be used to manipulate emotions or opinions.
- Manipulation of behaviour: Governments can use individual analysis to manipulate people’s behaviour and influence their decisions.
- Exploitation of individual: Governments can use individual analysis to exploit individuals for political and other purposes without their knowledge.

##### AI can summarize your life in a second for a government official
A deep government AI can quickly analyze a person's life by taking into account their online presence, social media activities, browsing history, and other data points. This could give a government official a comprehensive overview of who a person is and what they do, allowing them to make decisions about them quickly and accurately. Furthermore, the AI can also generate insight into a person's behavior, allowing officials to make predictions about their future actions. In this way, AI can be used to quickly analyze a person's life and provide a summary to a government official in seconds.

The misuse of AI to quickly analyze a person's life will lead to a number of troubling scenarios. For example, a government uses AI to quickly target individuals for surveillance or to spread misinformation. In addition, AI is used to manipulate public opinion by targeting individuals with specific ads or messages. Finally, AI is be used to exploit individuals for political and other purposes without their knowledge or consent. All of these scenarios present a major threat to individuals' independency, privacy, and freedom.

#### Transparency in Politics: A Dream of the Past?
- Government and political parties appear to be going against transparency.
- This could be due to a "controlled backlash", as leaks in past decades were a miracle which might not occur again in the digital age.

### Infantilization

The infantilization of our society is no accident. It is a carefully crafted plan by those in power to keep us in a state of perpetual childhood, unable to make decisions and take responsibility for our lives. From the way we dress and interact with each other, to the way we consume and spend our money, it is clear that the elites want us to remain in a childlike state.

In a recent study, researchers from the University of Toronto and the University of Arizona examined how infantilization is changing our society. They found that trends in technology, consumerism, and media are creating a “culture of infantilization,” in which adults lose the skills and abilities needed to make important decisions and take responsibility for their lives.

The researchers suggest that this is a deliberate ploy by the elites to control us. They point out that the way we dress and act is often more childlike than ever before, and that we’re becoming more dependent on technology to do tasks that we used to do ourselves. They also point out that our media consumption is increasingly more infantile, with an endless stream of memes and GIFs.

### Transhumanism
The combination of transhumanism, transgender, and transsexual culture is a dangerous one that threatens to bring about a new form of tyranny. Transhumanism seeks to use technology, such as genetic engineering, robotics, and nanotechnology, to create a new species of human that is superior to those that currently exist.

The combination of these three movements could create a world where those with superior physical abilities and capabilities are favored over those who are “normal.” This could lead to a society where those who are deemed “inferior” are discriminated against, and where everyone is judged based on their physical attributes rather than who they are as a person. It could also give rise to a totalitarian state in which the government has total control over its citizens and their lives.

Furthermore, the potential risks associated with transhumanism, transgender, and transsexual culture are extreme. For example, the use of technology to enhance humans could lead to unforeseen side effects and health risks, as well as ethical and moral implications. Additionally, there could be implications for privacy and safety, as well as legal issues surrounding the control of individuals’ bodies.

Ultimately, the combination of transhumanism, transgender, and transsexual culture could lead to a dystopian future in which those with superior physical attributes are favored over those who are “normal.” This could create a world where those who are deemed “inferior” are discriminated against, and where everyone is judged based on physical attributes rather than who they are as a person. There are also potential risks associated with this combination, such as health and safety concerns, as well as ethical and legal implications. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential risks and implications of this combination before embracing it.

## Chapter 9: Can we go now?

### Keeping network hot
In today’s world, the web is hot. Everywhere you go, you can find secret messages hidden in plain sight. Whether it’s an email, an Instagram post, or a text message, these messages contain coded meaning that only a special someone can understand.

List of examples of these messages:

- 69
- 420
- 1+1=3
- Coffee and a muffin

Have you ever heard someone say something that meant more than the words themselves? Something that was code for something else? If so, you know the power of keeping the web hot.

The web is a vast, interconnected network of people, ideas, and information. It's constantly changing and growing, and without some kind of “hot” element, it can become stale and boring. That’s where keeping the web hot comes in.

Keeping the web hot involves using coded phrases, messages, and symbols to communicate information without actually speaking it aloud. These messages can be anything from the ubiquitous “420” associated with cannabis to the seemingly innocent “1+1=3.” Even something as simple as “coffee and a muffin” can be code for something else.

The key to keeping the web hot is understanding the underlying meaning behind these messages and symbols. They may appear to be completely unrelated, but often times they are meant to convey something that the speaker may not even realize they’re conveying. It’s up to you to decipher the meaning and use it to your advantage

Some of these coded messages are known as “subconscious messages.” They’re messages that the sender may not be aware of consciously, yet they still convey a powerful meaning to the receiver. Subconscious messages can be incredibly powerful; they can influence how others think and feel without the sender being aware.

So how can you keep the web hot? Here are some tips:

Listen for messages. Pay attention to the subtle messages that people send through their conversations and interactions. Are there any hidden meanings that you can pick up on?

Send your own coded messages. Don’t be afraid to be creative and send your own coded messages. Think outside of the box and come up with clever ways to get your message across.

Be open to receiving messages. Be open to receiving messages from other people. Keep an open mind and be willing to take in the messages that people are trying to send you.

The web is always hot


### Avoiding obstacles

As humans, we’re constantly looking for ways to reach our goals and make progress in life. But sometimes, obstacles can get in the way of our plans. Whether these obstacles are physical, mental, or emotional, they can impede our progress and cause us to feel frustrated and discouraged.

Fortunately, there are strategies that can help us avoid obstacles and stay on the right path. Here are some tips on how to avoid obstacles:

1. Know your goal: The first step in avoiding obstacles is to know your goal. Clearly define your goal and create a plan for achieving it. This will help you stay focused and on track.

2. Identify potential obstacles: Once you’ve identified your goal, take some time to think about any potential obstacles that might stand in your way. Consider your own weaknesses and any external factors that could throw a wrench in your plans.

3. Create a contingency plan: Once you’ve identified potential obstacles, create a contingency plan for each one. By having a plan in place for when things don’t go as expected, you can minimize the risk of being derailed by an obstacle.

4. Stay focused: It’s easy to get distracted by shiny objects

5. Keep a log: write everything


### Searching your way somewhere

Have you ever set off on a journey, but had no idea where you were going? It can be a daunting experience, with no clear destination in sight. But if you look within yourself, you can find the courage to keep searching.

The act of searching can be thought of as a metaphor for our lives. When we search for something, we are looking within ourselves and our surroundings for the answers we seek. We may not know what the answer looks like, but we keep searching until we find it.

Searching can also represent our journey toward personal growth and understanding. We search within ourselves for the courage to take risks, to be open to new experiences, and to learn from our mistakes. We search around us for the support and guidance of those we trust and rely on.

Searching can also be a way to discover our passion and purpose in life. We search for the things that make us excited, the things that make us feel alive. We search for the things that bring us joy, that give us a sense of purpose and meaning.

Searching is a process of self-discovery. It’s about learning who we are and what we want out of life. We search for the things that make us unique, that make us stand out from the crowd. We search for the things that make us feel alive and connected to the world around us.

Searching is a journey that never ends. We continue searching, learning, and growing throughout our lives. We search for the answers, the courage, and the passion that will lead us to our destination. We search for the things that will help us become the best version of ourselves.

So when you find yourself at a crossroads and you don’t know where to go, don’t be afraid to keep searching. Search within yourself, search around you, and search for the things that will bring you joy. As long as you keep searching, you’ll eventually find your way somewhere.

### Happiness in everything

Happiness is like a spark that can ignite in any moment and in any place. It is a light that illuminates the darkness and brings warmth to the cold. It is a feeling that is often sought after and yet, it can be found in the simplest of moments.

We often think of happiness as something that must be found in the most extraordinary of circumstances; a luxurious vacation, a well-deserved promotion, or a perfect romantic relationship. But the truth is, happiness can be found in the everyday.

It can be found in the mundane rituals of getting ready for work in the morning. It can be found in the laughter of children playing in the park. It can be found in the warmth of the sun on a beautiful spring day.

Happiness is everywhere, if you look for it. It doesn’t need to be flashy or expensive. It doesn’t need to be complicated or over-the-top. It just needs to be noticed and appreciated.

The key is to find joy in the little things. Appreciate the beauty of a sunset. Enjoy a cup of coffee with a friend. Take pleasure in a good book. Feel the warmth of a hug.

Happiness is not a destination. It’s not something that you can find once and keep forever. It’s something that you have to search for every day. But if you open your eyes and your heart, you’ll find that it’s everywhere.
