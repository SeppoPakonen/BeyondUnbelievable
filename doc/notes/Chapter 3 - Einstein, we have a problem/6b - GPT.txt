Uncovering the Mystery of Gravity and Anti-Gravity

Summarization of the whole text as a short section in a another documentary video:

Gravity is an imbalance in the electric force that produces a weak attracting force between neutral bodies. This explains why the formula for Newton's universal law of gravity is so similar to Coulomb's law. Anti-gravity is the opposite of gravity and manifests itself as a high pressure in the regions away from the gravitational field. Gravity and anti-gravity cannot be shielded from, as their effects daisy-chain out to other bodies.
