Title: Exploring the Size of Photons

Summary: In this documentary, we explore the size of photons and how it relates to their energy. We discuss the size of zero-point photons, radio-wave photons, visible light photons, x-rays, and gamma-rays, and how the size of these photons is related to their ability to pass through materials. We then use the slalom analogy to explain the phenomenon of refraction and diffraction in optics and how Snell's law can be used as evidence to support the idea that light is a particle and not a wave.
