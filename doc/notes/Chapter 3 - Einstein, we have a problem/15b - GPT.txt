Title: Hollow Planets - Exploring the Possibility of Our Planet's Structure

Short Summary: This article explores the possibility that our planet Earth is hollow, and that this hollow structure could explain various phenomena such as gravity anomalies, the expansion of our planet, and the origin of water in the oceans. It argues that the potential difference between the ionosphere and the surface of the planet, combined with the possibility of a repelling electrical force at its centre, make a hollow structure a plausible option. Additionally, seismic evidence and NASA's measurements of Jupiter's core density suggest that hollow planets are indeed possible. Finally, the article proposes that the gravitational force is not only dependent on mass, but also on the electrical environment in which the force is made.
