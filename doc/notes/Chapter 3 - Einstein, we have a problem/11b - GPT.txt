Title: The Double Slit Experiment: Exploring Wave-Like Properties of Matter

Short Summary: The double slit experiment has been used to prove that not just photons, but all matter has wave-like properties. Pilot Wave Theory can be used to explain these properties. Zero-point particles form a standing wave and when a particle is sent through space it bobs along on that wave. The larger the particle, the less affected it is by the wave and the tighter the pattern observed at the detector. Neutrinos, photons, and gravity also influence the behavior of particles observed in the double slit experiment.
