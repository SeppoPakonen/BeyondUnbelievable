Title: Understanding Electric Currents Through the Faraday Effect

Summarization: Electric currents can be explained by the Faraday Effect, which shows that there is a direct relationship between magnetism and light. Magnetic fields fan out to the side, producing high and low pressure areas in the aether, and producing repelling or attracting forces. Different materials react differently to magnetic fields, and ferromagnetic materials can be induced with a permanent magnetic field, allowing them to be used for electric currents.
