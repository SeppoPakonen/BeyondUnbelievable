Catching Title: Discovering the Stabilizing Force Behind Orbits

Summary: This documentary highlights the importance of electric repulsion to the stability of orbits. It explains how electric repulsion works to keep our Moon and other astronomic bodies in stable orbits, and how it explains the circular shape of impact craters and the synthesis of water in comets. It also explains the consequences of rogue planets entering a solar system, and how electrical repulsion is the force that ultimately determines whether the rogue planet is captured or ejected.
