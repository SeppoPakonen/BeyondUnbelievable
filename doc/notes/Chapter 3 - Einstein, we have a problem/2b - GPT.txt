Unlocking Morton Spears' Particle Quanta: Exploring the Subatomic World.


Summarization of the whole text as a short section in a another documentary video:

Morton Spears proposed a simpler alternative to standard particle physics. His model is made up of three indestructible particle quanta: one negatively charged, one positively charged, and one neutral. The proton is made up of 1089 positive quanta and 1088 negative quanta, and the neutron is made up of 1090 positive and 1090 negative quanta. The electron is made up of 2 negative quanta and 1 positive quantum, and the neutrino is made up of a single neutral quantum. The strong force that binds atomic nuclei is explained in terms of texture, and the photon is made of an equal number of positive and negative charge quanta in a closed state.
