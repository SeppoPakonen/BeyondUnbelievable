Exploring Electric Currents and Permanent Magnets through Zero-Point Photons

Summarization of the whole text as a short section in a another documentary video:

Electric current is the motion of charged particles, typically electrons, through a conducting wire. Every electric current generates a magnetic field around it, which can be explained in terms of zero-point photons being polarized and set spinning. Permanent magnets are pieces of metal, usually iron, which have a permanent magnetic field associated with them. This field is caused by the atoms of the metal hooking onto one side of nearby zero-point photons more readily than the other side.
