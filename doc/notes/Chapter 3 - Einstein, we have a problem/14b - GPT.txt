Title: Exploring the Proton-Electron Atom and the Possibilities of Transmutations

Summary: This document explores the proton-electron atom model and how it can explain radioactivity and transmutations such as nuclear fusion and fission. It also examines the concept of antimatter and how it can be explained by the same model. This model suggests that mass condensation onto the proton is the cause of radioactivity, and that transmutations can be achieved through the consumption or shedding of protons, electrons, or positrons.
