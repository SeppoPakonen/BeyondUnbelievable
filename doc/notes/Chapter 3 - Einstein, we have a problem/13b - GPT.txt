Catching Title: How Mass Condensation Explains the Unusual Fossil Records

Summarization: Mass condensation is an interesting hypothesis that suggests that matter is becoming more massive over time. This process is driven by photons crashing into already existing matter, thereby increasing its mass. The fossil records show evidence of creatures that would be impossible in today's environment, due to the increased mass and gravity. This suggests that both inertia and gravity have increased over time, exactly as hypothesized by Halton Arp.
