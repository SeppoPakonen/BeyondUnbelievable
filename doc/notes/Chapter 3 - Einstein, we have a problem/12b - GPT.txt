Title: The Mystery of Red-Shifted Light

Summary: Light from distant bodies is often red-shifted, meaning that it appears to be shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. This phenomenon has been used to infer that our universe is expanding, but could there be other explanations? This video looks at different theories, such as the tired light hypothesis and intrinsic red-shift, which suggest that the red-shift of light may be due to a loss of energy as photons are travelling through the universe, or due to the fact that young matter has less mass than older matter.
