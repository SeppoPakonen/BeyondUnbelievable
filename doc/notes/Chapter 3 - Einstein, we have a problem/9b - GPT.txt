Title: The Power of Induction: How Magnets Create Electric Currents

Summarization: This documentary video explores the power of induction, or the ability of magnets to create electric currents in wires. Using the right-hand rule of electromagnetism and the properties of polarized photons, this video explains how electric motors and generators work, how radio transmission is possible, and why Faraday cages can protect from electric and magnetic forces.
