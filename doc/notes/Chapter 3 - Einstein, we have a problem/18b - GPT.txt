Title: The Electric Universe: A New Perspective

Summary: This book explores the idea that electricity is the driving force behind the universe, rather than gravity as is commonly believed. It examines the evidence for electric plasma currents in space, and suggests that supernovas are the births of stars and planets, rather than their deaths. It further suggests that our Sun is powered by electricity, and that stars are simply large planets with thick mineral-rich atmospheres. Lastly, it proposes a life-cycle of matter, which solves the problem of heat death through entropy. Together, these ideas offer a new perspective on the universe and its workings.
