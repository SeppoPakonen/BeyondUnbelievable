Title: The Eternal Universe: Exploring an Alternative Model of Physics

Summarization: This book explores an alternative model of physics in which electricity, rather than gravity, is the main force in the universe. It proposes that distance is a relative measure of inertial matter, energy is stored as size in subatomic particles, and time slows down for particles with increased energy. The book also explains the Mercury Anomaly, the neutrino that appears when a free neutron decays, and the idea that the universe is an eternal ecosystem with no start and no end.
