Explaining the Electric Force Using Zero-Point Neutrinos

Summarization of the whole text as a short section in a another documentary video:

The electric force can be explained entirely in terms of zero-point neutrinos. When a neutrino hits an object with a charge, it carries a footprint of the charge with it and creates a low or high pressure in the aether depending on the charge of the neutrino. Neutral bodies also experience attraction to charged surfaces due to the distortion of the distribution of charges. Coulomb's law can be explained in terms of the probability of collisions between charged neutrinos, which is related to the product of the two charges, and the availability of zero-point neutrinos.
