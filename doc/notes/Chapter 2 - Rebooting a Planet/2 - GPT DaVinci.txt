In this Space News from the Electric Universe, brought to you by The Thunderbolts Projectâ„¢ at Thunderbolts.info, a new scientific study suggests that planetary formation is a process that happens exponentially faster than astronomers have ever thought possible. Scientists using images from the Alma and VLA telescopes have proposed that a sufficient amount of dust to form planets around a parent star, arises surprisingly early in a star's life. In recent years, scientific discovery has forced a similar crisis on the question of how stars form, with observations of the Snake nebula showing that material needed to be drawn in to form massive stars, is far less than gravitational models predict. The Electric Universe and plasma cosmology propose that the electromagnetic phenomenon called the Z-pinch is a dominant organizational phenomenon in the cosmos, and Wal Thornhill has proposed that planets also form electromagnetically, often along the same current filaments on which stars form. Moreover, evidence for both stars and planets forming in pairs, the result of the electrical "doubling effect" of twin current filaments, has been found. The astounding successes of these predictions make them worthy of sober scientific investigation at the level of institutionalized science.

A new scientific study suggests that planet formation may occur much faster than previously thought. Astronomers have been puzzled by the lack of planet-forming dust in star systems, and the team behind the study proposes that a sufficient amount of dust arises surprisingly early in a star's life. In recent years, scientific discovery has also forced a similar crisis on the question of how stars form. The Electric Universe and plasma cosmology propose that the electromagnetic phenomenon called the Z-pinch is a dominant organizational phenomenon in the cosmos, and Wal Thornhill has proposed that planets also form electromagnetically, often along the same current filaments on which stars form. The pairing of filaments can concentrate matter in toroids and closely orbiting bodies, and the weird zoo of exoplanetary systems has only affirmed the astounding failure of gravitational accretion theory to explain science discovery. The Electric Universe and plasma cosmology have made successful predictions and are worthy of sober scientific investigation.
