[A beautiful astronomy image]
For thousands of years, we humans have gazed up at the sky and wondered,
[A beautiful astronomy image "Pillars of creation"]
looked for messages, looked for keys to deeper understanding.

[A beautiful astronomy image of something with red circles]
But perhaps the cosmos is laughing.
Do we really see the universe as it is or as we thought it should be?

[The Earth photographed from ISS and it shows auroras well]
Throughout the space-age, astonishment and surprise have been the hallmark of scientific progress.

[A close photograph of north polar hexagon on Saturn]
Everywhere we've looked, whether close to Earth or in remote space, we've uncovered things forbidden by our theories.
What we expected to find, we've not found.

[A beautiful astronomy image of astronomical explosion]
And things beyond all expectation have become commonplace.

[A beautiful astronomy image of some rectangular formation]
In science a surprise is always good news.
It prods us to see things differently, to ask more pointed questions.

[A beautiful astronomy image of some orange dust formation]
One discovery in space inspires another, and beneath it all today is the encounter with the one thing our theories didn't allow
[A beautiful astronomy image of deep space galaxies and red and blue dust]
-- intense electromagnetism.
Electrical and magnetic energies in the vacuum of space beyond anything astronomers expected.

[A beautiful astronomy image of deep space galaxies and a single large yellow galaxy]
That's what has happened as astronomers, physicists, and planetary scientists, have come face to face with the Electric Universe.
