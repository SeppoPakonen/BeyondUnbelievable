Reverse Engineering the Earth: Exploring the Patterns of Nature with Electric Forces


Summarization of the script as a short section in a another documentary video:

Andrew Hall's "Eye of the Storm" series presents evidence that electrical forces shaped the Colorado Plateau and its surroundings. He demonstrates how the patterns of nature, such as mountains, are formed by the diffusion of charge in an environment of extreme electrical stress. He shares his three favorite Easter eggs: first, the Dragoon Mountains in Southern Arizona which were formed by supersonic plasma winds and second, ancient myth which tells the story of a powerful coronal storm in human history. Finally, he shares his favorite example of a boulder with a runny nose and explains how shockwaves created the features.

Summarization of the script as a short section in a another documentary video without subject Andrew Hall and Thunderbolts Project:

In this chapter, we explored the Electric Earth theory which suggests that electrical forces shape the planet and its surroundings. We looked at the patterns of charge diffusion and how it forms circuits, and how planetary bodies respond to high potentials. We also explored how mountains can form from supersonic plasma winds, with evidence of tetrahedral shapes and pillow rocks. Finally, we looked at an example of a monolithic granite tetrahedron to further explore the electric earth theory.
